              I'm a certified Pega CSSA with a passion for transforming complex business 
              challenges into elegant, automated solutions. My expertise spans across 
              low-code platforms, Generative AI, and Natural Language Processing.

              With years of experience in enterprise automation, I've helped organizations 
              streamline their processes while maintaining the human touch that makes 
              technology truly meaningful. I believe in building systems that don't just 
              workâ€”they inspire.

              When I'm not architecting solutions, you'll find me exploring the latest 
              developments in AI, mentoring fellow developers, or contributing to 
              open-source projects that push the boundaries of what's possible.
